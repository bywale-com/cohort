# cohort

Cohort is built for operations teams who run shifts and live inside the same recurring problem: coverage breaks don’t announce themselves early, and when they finally surface, they surface as urgency. A call-in. A no-show. A last-minute surge. The work doesn’t pause, but the plan does. In that moment, the burden lands on supervisors and ops—phones ringing, scrambling for a replacement, re-routing work, calming stakeholders, and then updating whoever supplied the labor after the disruption has already hit.

Cohort exists to reverse that timeline. Instead of ops being the first to feel a gap, Cohort pushes accountability upstream so coverage reliability becomes visible before the shift is already breaking. From the user’s perspective, it feels like moving from reactive firefighting to controlled coverage: you can see what’s actually covered, what’s at risk, and what’s being actively handled—without needing to chase people down or run manual checklists just to confirm you’re safe.

The software sits in the middle of the workflow your team already has. It’s not “another system” that creates more admin; it’s an operational layer designed to reduce last-minute scramble. Cohort maintains a ready bench aligned to your environment and site requirements, so when a drop happens, replacement selection and mobilization happens before your floor is exposed. Teams with multiple sites, day/night rotations, and strict fit requirements use Cohort to avoid the worst trade in shift work: trading predictability for speed.

If you already run in-house coverage, use vendors, or a mix of both, Cohort doesn’t require a rip-and-replace. It’s designed to plug into what you’re already doing and remove the specific pain your people actually feel: being the last to know, and the first to absorb the consequences.
